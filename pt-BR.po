msgstr ""

msgid "The game engine provides the basic building block of a game, the underlying technology. A good engine also enables things like multiplayer support, video playback and realistic physics."
msgstr ""

msgid "Gameplay defines how a player interacts with the game and how the game mechanics, the rules that make a game tick, work."
msgstr ""

msgid "Storytelling and giving players goals to complete have been the basics of games for a long time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stage 2"
msgstr ""

msgid "Dialogues are part of storytelling as well but also provide interaction between NPC's (non-player characters) and the player."
msgstr ""

msgid "Level design defines the structure a player takes through a game. This includes simple things like where objects are located but also the story arcs in a game."
msgstr ""

msgid "A.I. is how computer controlled entities (enemies, companions or the world itself) reacts to the player."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stage 3"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some games invent an entire virtual world. World design delivers a back story to a game and makes the game world more sophisticated and believable."
msgstr ""

msgid "Graphics"
msgstr ""

msgid "The most obvious part of a game are its graphics but that doesn't mean it is always the most important part."
msgstr ""

msgid "While sound is not as often noticed as the graphics of a game, sound design plays a vital part to making a game great."
msgstr ""
