MMOs not only generate income but also cause maintenance costs as we need to run game servers and provide customer services. You will see the amount of maintenance paid in the sales card.{n}Unlike other games which have a limited sales duration MMOs sell indefinitely. You will have to decide yourself when you want to take an MMO off the market. To take an MMO off the market simply {0} on the sales card to bring up a menu.{n}Since MMOs are so expensive to create you might want to try to expand your current MMO rather than create a new one.
