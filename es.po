To create such an MMO more research is necessary.{n}The second discovery is that we could start developing an online distribution platform. Instead of players buying games in local stores they could download games directly from our servers. This would cut out the middle man and we could gain a large share of the market and additional income to fund our developments."

msgid "The game engine provides the basic building block of a game, the underlying technology. A good engine also enables things like multiplayer support, video playback and realistic physics."
msgstr ""

msgid "Gameplay defines how a player interacts with the game and how the game mechanics, the rules that make a game tick, work."
msgstr ""

msgid "Storytelling and giving players goals to complete have been the basics of games for a long time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stage 2"
msgstr ""

msgid "Dialogues are part of storytelling as well but also provide interaction between NPC's (non-player characters) and the player."
msgstr ""

msgid "Level design defines the structure a player takes through a game. This includes simple things like where objects are located but also the story arcs in a game."
msgstr ""

msgid "A.I. is how computer controlled entities (enemies, companions or the world itself) reacts to the player."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stage 3"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some games invent an entire virtual world. World design delivers a back story to a game and makes the game world more sophisticated and believable."
